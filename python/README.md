## Preface
**Algorithms**  
An algorithm describes the instructions (i.e., steps and operations) required to solve a problem. They can be expressed in natural languages (e.g., English and Spanish) or computer languages (e.g., Python). Algorithms expressed in computer languages are called computer programs. It is more efficient to develop algorithms or solutions in a natural language before implementing it as a computer program. 

**Statements**  
A statement is an instruction that does something with a value (e.g., assign it or print it). 
```python
answer = 1 + 1 # this is statement that includes an expression
```

**Expressions**  
An expression returns a value and is often part of a statement. Built-in function calls (e.g., using input to ask for a value) are also considered expressions 
```python
1 + 1 # this is an expression
```

**Evaluation**  
An evaluation is the act of determining the value of an expression. 

**General Purpose languages**  
A general purpose language can be used for:
* Developing
  * Desktop apps
  * Web apps
  * Mobile apps
* Automation
* Data analysis
* Data visualization
* Machine learning

**Interpreter vs Compiled Languages**  
An interpreted language means instructions are converted to machine code one at a time. The alternative to an interpreted language is a compiled language. Compiled languages convert instructions to machine code all at once. Instructions written in an interpreted language can be executed anywhere as long as the source code and interpreter is present. Instructions written in a compiled language must be converted to machine code before it can be executed. Yet, compiled programs can be executed an infinite number of times without needing the source
code or interpreter present.  

## Introduction
### Python Interpreter Modes
The Python language interpreter executes instructions in one of two modes. 

**Interactive Mode**  
In interactive mode, instructions are written and executed one at a time (like a discussion). 

**Script Mode**  
In script mode, all instructions are written before being executed one at a time (like a script). 

### Accessing the Python Interpreter
The Python interpreter can be accessed directly or indirectly. 

**Direct Access**  
Direct access involves using the Python interpreter on your computer. 

**Indirect Access**  
Indirect access involves using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). 

## Pythonâ€™s Integrated Development and Learning Environment
Python ships with an IDE called Integrated Development and Learning Environment (IDLE). It has two main features: Shell and Editor. 

**Editor**  
The editor is a text-editor. It allows you to write and then run programs in Python. It allows you to use the Python interpreter in script mode. 

**Shell**  
The shell provides indirect access to the Python interpreter. It allows you to use the Python interpreter in interactive mode.
