# Data Analysis

## Pandas
Pandas is based on NumPy.

**Pandas Series**  
A pandas series is a one-dimensional list. 
```python
series = [0, a, b, c]
```

**Pandas DataFrame**  
A pandas DataFrame is a table (multiple series joined together). Each series in a DataFrame is mapped to a column name.  
```python
dataFrame = [
  [0, a, b, c],
  [1, a, b, d],
  [2, a, k, v]
]
```
