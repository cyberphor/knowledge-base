# Data Analysis

## Pandas
Pandas is based on NumPy.

**Pandas Series**  
A pandas series is a one-dimensional list. The index of a series can be thought of as "labels."

**Pandas DataFrame**  
A pandas DataFrame is a table (multiple series joined together). Each series in a DataFrame is mapped to a column name.
