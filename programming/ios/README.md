## Setup
**What type of files do I need?**  
Images and sound files. 

**What type of images should I use?**  
Apple developer documentation highly recommends the Portable Network Graphic (PNG) format because it "provides lossless image content, meaning that saving image data to a PNG format and then reading it back results in the exact same pixel values. PNG also has an optimized storage format designed for faster reading of the image data. It is the preferred image format for iOS." (Apple Developer Documentation Archive, n.d.)

**What size images do I need?**  
The background depends on the resolution of the platform (e.g., iPhone 13 is 1170 x 2532). You probably need one background each for each platform you want to support too.

**How do I make my own images?**  
Download and use a image editor (e.g., GIMP) to create files that meet your image requirements. The size of an image is defined by its width and height. For example, to create a background image that is 1170 x 2532, you would set the file width to 1170 and height to 2532. 

**What categories of images do I need?**  
Background, sprites, and animations (i.e., sprite sheets).

**What type of sprites do I need?**  
Player, enemies, objects, and animations.
