# Automation
Automation is when machines are used to perform tasks instead of humans. Scripting, configuration management, and infrastructure orchestration all use automation. 

## Benefits
Automation provides the benefits described below. 

**Reduce the Time Required**  
Machines are faster than humans. 

**Improve Consistency**  
Machines are more consistent than humans. They can perform a task the same way every time (e.g., deploying resources in a specific order). 

## Scripting
Scripting is when the following are used perform a task instead of a human. 
* A file containing procedures 
* An interpreter 

## Configuration Management
Configuration Management (CM) is when the following are used to perform a task instead of a human. 
* A file containing procedures or declarations
* An interpreter

## Infrastructure Orchestration
Infrastructure orchestration is when the following are used to perform a task instead of a human. Unlike CM, infrastructure orchestration can negotiate configuration conflicts for you. 
* A file containing declarations
* An interpreter
* A version control system
