# Cloud Monitoring
**Cloud Monitoring**  
Cloud monitoring is the process of monitoring the availability and performance of cloud-based infrastructure. 

**Availability Tests**   
Availability tests are used to check if an app is responding as expected. 

**Scaling**  
Scaling is the process of adjusting infrastructure to meet changes in demand. Workloads in production are too unpredictable for manual scaling. The Azure Monitor service provides auto-scaling.
