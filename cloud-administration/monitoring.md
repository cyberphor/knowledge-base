# Monitoring

**Motivation**  
We need to know if there are errors, failures, and changes in performance. 

## Logs, Metrics, Traces
**Logs**  
Logs are used to record interesting events. 

**Metrics**
Metrics are samples of ongoing conditions. 

**Traces**  
Traces describe a chain of events across a system.
