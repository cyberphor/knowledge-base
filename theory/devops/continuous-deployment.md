# Continuous Deployment
Continuous Deployment is a process used to release software into the production environment automatically. It includes the software development phases listed below. 
* User acceptance testing
* Automated deployment to the staging environment
* Automated deployment to the production environment
* Smoke testing

### Deployment Pipelines
**Artifacts**

**Continous Deployment**  
Properties
* Automated software delivery
* Seamless integration
* Minimal human intervention
* Customer-centric approach

Benefits
* Faster time to market
* Reduced manual errors
* Enhanced user satsifaction
* CD implements Agile development

## Text Goes Here
* Acceptance Test
* Deploy to Staging
* Deploy to Production
* Smoke Tests (check if it works and there is nothing burning)

## Toil
Below are some examples of toil. 
* Copying commands from a playbook
* Running a script
* Handling user requests
* Reviewing non-critical alerts

## Artifacts
* Source code
* Version Control System
* Automated build artifacts
* Test reports
* Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) files
* Container images

## Releases
### Types of Issues Before and After a Release
**Coding Issues**  
Examples of coding issues are logic errors, unexpected edge cases, and deprecated libraries.

**Infrastructure Issues**  
An example of an infrastructure issue is the horizontal scaling of compute, storage, and/or network resources.

**Configuration Issues**  
Inconsistent configurations cause unexpected behavior. 

**Integration Issues**  
Examples of integration issues are incompatibility and poor connectivity.

**Performance Issues**  
Examples of performance issues are poor system response time and resource utilization.

**Security Issues**  
Examples of security issues are the loss of information confidentiality and information integrity. 

### Mitigating Issues
Below is a list of strategies for mitigating issues before and after a release. 

**Collaboration**  
Establish incident response procedures and clear communication channels between teams first.

**CI/CD**  
Promote small updates over big ones. Small updates take less time to debug and therefore allow you to respond to issues faster. 

**Testing**  
Perform Unit Testing, Integration Testing, User Acceptance Testing, and Code Reviews. 

**Automation**  
Automate the build, test, and deploy phases of your SDLC. 

**Monitoring**  
Track system response time, the utilization of hardware, errors, user behavior, and application logs.
