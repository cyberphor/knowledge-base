# Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence is human intelligence by machines (e.g., expert systems, computer vision, and ML). AI can conduct localization (i.e., identify where it is; this task is not ML). 

AI needs context (i.e., poor weather conditions) to make decisions and be accurate. 
* Synthetic data: fake data made to address situations where real data cannot be used. 
  * Scenario: detecting when a voice is real or fake.

## Expert Systems
A tree of if statements. 

## Machine Learning
[Machine learning](/theory/data-science/artificial-intelligence/machine-learning/README.md) is a subset of AI. Machine learning systems make predictions. Machine learning systems can learn from experience to find patterns in data. 

### Deep Learning
Deep learning is a subset of ML. It uses Deep Neural Networks. 
* Deep = several layers of networks. 

### Deep Neural Networks

### Neural Networks
A network of nodes and edges (i.e., connections).  

### Structured Data
Structured data has a schema.
