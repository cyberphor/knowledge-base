# Reinforcement Learning
Learning from reward or punishment signals. Most use-cases: get your simulated environment to mirror real environments (“sim-to-real”). Tune your reward signals to address situations where the model does nothing (e.g., a car remains parked so it doesn’t get a penalty). 
* VSOR: stimulus organism response.
