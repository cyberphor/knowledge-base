# Data Science
Data science is an interdisciplinary field that includes Domain Expertise, Mathematics, and Computer Science. 

**Analytics Data Science Projects**  
Analytic data science projects are used to gain insight from a data set (e.g., generate a report). 

**Exploratory Data Science Projects**  
Exploratory data science projects are used to identify solutions/problems using a data set.

**Development Data Science Projects**  
Development data science projects are used to develop intelligence apps (e.g., AI). 

## Software Development Life Cycle Model
Data science projects do not use Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) models like Agile. They often include four phases or steps:
1. Develop an understanding of the business
2. Develop an understanding of the data set
3. Develop a model
4. Deploy the model

### Develop an Understanding of the Business
**Identify business objectives using the organizationâ€™s needs**  
Background, key variables, standards of success.

**Assess the situation**  
Resources, requirements, assumptions, constraints, risks, lexicon, costs.

**Identify your data science goals using the organization's business objectives**  
Data Science Goals: your goals will answer one or more of the questions listed below.
* Regression: determine how many
* Failed logins to allow before blocking something
* Classification: determine a category
* Clustering: determine a group
* Anomaly Detection: determine if something is normal
* Recommendation: determine the best COA

### Develop an Understanding of the Data Set
**Ingest data**  
Your target analytic environment may originate from organic data or designed study data.

**Explore data to understand**  
Noise, missing values, and sufficiency.

**Establish a data pipeline**  
It may be batch-based (i.e., groups of files at a time), streaming-based, or a hybrid.

**Prepare the dataset**  
Selecting, cleaning, integrating, and formatting data.

### Develop a Model
**Feature engineering**  
Transform, binning temporal, text, image, and feature selection.

**Model training**  
Algorithms, ensemble, parameter tuning, retraining.

**Model evaluation**  
Cross validation, model reporting, A/B testing.

### Deploy the Model
