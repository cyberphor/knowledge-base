# Recommender Systems
A recommender system is anything that takes a set of users and a set of items and returns a recommendation. They are used to predict what someone will given an unknown item based on existing data. Developing a recommender system includes a number of challenges. For example, the diversity of data ranges from coarse to fine. The recommendation must also be tailored to the user, otherwise the system sucks. Finally, new users will always experience cold-starts with recommender systems. Recommender systems can't given good recommendations if they don't have enough data about the user.
