# Machine Learning
**Programming**  
```python
def computer(data, program):
    output = program(data)
    return output
```

**Machine Learning**  
ML is based on data, not knowledge. 
```python
output = labeling(data)
def computer(data, output):
    model = ml(data, output)
    return model # a model is a program
```

**Duties & Responsibilities By Role**  
* Gather Data: AI Tech
* Store Data: AI Tech
* Prepare Data: ML Engineer
* Data Cleaning
* Feature Extraction
* Feature Selection
* Train ML Model: ML Engineer & AI Tech
* Eval and Tune: ML Engineer
* Deploy and Monitor: AI Tech

## Types
**Supervised Learning**  
Learning from labeled data. Labeling is hard because humans have biases (skewed perspectives). 

**Unsupervised Learning**  
Learning from unlabeled data by looking for patterns. Categorizing data based on similarities. 

**Reinforcement Learning**  
Learning from reward or punishment signals. Most use-cases: get your simulated environment to mirror real environments (“sim-to-real”). Tune your reward signals to address situations where the model does nothing (e.g., a car remains parked so it doesn’t get a penalty). 
* VSOR: stimulus organism response.
