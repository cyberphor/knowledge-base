# Zero Trust
Zero Trust is a security model. In previous security models, trust was mostly based on your location. The security boundary was the network perimeter. In the Zero Trust model, the security boundary is dynamic. 

## Principles
Zero Trust promotes three principles. 
1. Always verify
2. Least privilege
3. Assume breach

**Always Verify**  
The principle of "always verify" requires every request to be authenticated. 

**Least Privilege**  
The principle of "least privilege" requires organizations to assign only the privileges required to get something done to the people that need it. The main theme here is authorization. 

**Assume Breach**  
The principle of "assume breach" requires organizations to *behave* as if there is a threat actor already in their network (to some people, the word "breach" means information has been exposed). For example, assuming breach may involve the controls listed below. 
* Segmenting networks to lower the impact of an incident
* Encrypting data-in-transit and data-at-rest to lower the probabilty of an incident
* Use metrics to prevent and detect incidents
