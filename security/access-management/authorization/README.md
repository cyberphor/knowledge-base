# Authorization 
Authorization is what an entity is allowed to do to an object. 

**Permissions**  
Permissions represent what you're allowed to do with an object. 

## Authorization Schemes
**Discretionary Access Control**  
Discretionary Access Control (DAC) is when access is evaluated using Access Control Lists. 

**Mandatory Access Control**  
Mandatory Access Control (MAC) is when access is evaluated using labels and account classifications. A subject must possess the right classification to access an object with a specific label. 

**Role-Based Access Control**  
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is when access is evaluated by the subject's role. RBAC uses roles to represent and manage authorization. For example, a user will only be authorized to modify a resource if were assigned a "Editor" role (i.e., their account was added to the "Editors" group).
