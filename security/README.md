# Security
The word "security" originates from the the latin phrase *secura* which means "free from care" ("se" is "free from" and "cura" is "care"). As in, one is secure when they don't need aid. They are free from trouble and don't need help. 

## Governance
Data governance is represented by the activities listed below. 
* Assigning a data owner
* Classifying data
* Managing the lifecycle of data
* Preventing data loss

## Zero Trust
Zero Trust is a security model. In previous security models, trust was mostly based on your location. The security boundary was the network perimeter. In the Zero Trust model, the security boundary is dynamic. 

### Principles
Zero Trust promotes three principles. 
1. Always verify
2. Least privilege
3. Assume breach

**Always Verify**  
The principle of "always verify" requires every request to be authenticated. 

**Least Privilege**  
The principle of "least privilege" requires organizations to assign only the privileges required to get something done to the people that need it. The main theme here is authorization. 

**Assume Breach**  
The principle of "assume breach" requires organizations to *behave* as if there is a threat actor already in their network (to some people, the word "breach" means information has been exposed). For example, assuming breach may involve the controls listed below. 
* Segmenting networks to lower the impact of an incident
* Encrypting data-in-transit and data-at-rest to lower the probability of an incident
* Use metrics to prevent and detect incidents
