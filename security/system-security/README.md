## Hardening
* Disabling default accounts (reduce the probability of the attacker using the right identity)
* Disabling unnecessary services (e.g., the print spooler on your domain controller)
* Disabling unnecessary features (e.g., screen recording software)
* Disabling weak ciphers (to mitigate downgrade attacks)
* Configuring application whitelisting
* Installing anti-malware software (signature-based)
* Installing a host-based IDS (can be signature or behavior-based)
* Installing a host-based IPS (behavior-based and proactive) 
* Installing an Endpoint Detection and Response Agent (behavior-based and reactive)
* Installing a File Integrity Checker 

**Host Intrusion Detection System**  
Monitors network traffic for patterns. 

**Endpoint Detection and Response**  
Monitors network traffic, DNS requests, memory operations, process behavior for thresholds of suspicion.
