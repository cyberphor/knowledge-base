## Data Types
### Structured Data  
Structured data follows a schema. 

**Schema**  
A schema defines field data types, field formats, and relationships between tables. It also requires all records in a table to have the same fields. It’s hard to change a schema after it’s created without having a negative impact. 

### Semi-Structured Data
Semi-structured data is defined using tags. They look like dictionaries (e.g., JSON, XML, and graph data). New fields can be added without having a negative impact on existing data. 

### Unstructured Data
Unstructured data is data that does not use a schema or tags. Some examples are images, audio files, video files, email, and Microsoft Office documents. 

**Blobs**
An instance of unstructured data is called a Binary Large Object (BLOB) or blob. Blobs (i.e., unstructured data) account for most of the world’s data.
