# Scaling

**Scaling**  
Scaling is a manual or automated processed for increasing the vertical or horizontal capacity of a resource. 

## Capacity Planning
Capacity planning is when an organization measures the utilization of existing IT services to establish a benchmark for future expansion. Below are some examples:
* If one cabinet can support 1,000 users, two additional cabinets would be needed for the organization to support 3,000. 
* If 5 licenses can support 100 servers, 6 licenses would be needed to support up to 120.

## Vertical Scaling
Vertical scaling (aka "scaling up") is when old technology is upgraded or replaced with newer technology (e.g., faster CPUs and memory). The number of resources does NOT change after something has been vertically scaled. 

## Horizontal Scaling
Horizontal scaling (aka "scaling out") is when the number of resources dedicated to a system is increased or decreased (e.g., adding an additional CPU). Itâ€™s used to address task division and assignment.
