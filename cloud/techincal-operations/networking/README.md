# Networking
Cloud administration depends on the networking concepts described below. 

## Software-Defined Networking
Software-Defined Networking (SDN) separates networking interfaces into Data and Control Planes. The Data Plane includes trunk and access ports. The Control Plane includes management interfaces and is hosted on a dedicated server called a "Controller."

## Secure Remote Administration
Secure Remote Administration is when secure protocols are used to connect to a CSP and manage cloud services. Secure protocols ensure data is encrypted when it's transmitted, used, and stored. 

**Secure Protocols**
* Secure Shell (SSH)
* Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)
* Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
