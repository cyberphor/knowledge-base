# Design

The design of a cloud is based on decisions relating to the following:
* [Cloud Service Model](/cloud/README.md#service-models)
* [Cloud Service Deployment Model](/cloud/README.md#service-deployment-models)
* [Scalability](#scalability)
* [Risk Management](#risk-management)

## Scalability
Increasing the capacity of an IT solution vertically (i.e., add more) or horizontally (i.e., replace or upgrade). 

**Scale-Up**

**Scale-Out**

### Vertical Scaling
Vertical scaling is when old technology is upgraded or replaced with newer technology (e.g., faster CPUs and memory). The number of resources does NOT change after something has been vertically scaled. 

### Horizontal Scaling
Horizontal scaling is when the number of resources dedicated to a system is increased or decreased (e.g., adding an additional CPU). Itâ€™s used to address task division and assignment. 

## Capacity Planning
Capacity planning is when an organization measures the utilization of existing IT services to establish a benchmark for future expansion. Below are some examples:
* If one cabinet can support 1,000 users, two additional cabinets would be needed for the organization to support 3,000. 
* If 5 licenses can support 100 servers, 6 licenses would be needed to support up to 120.

## Risk Management
**Redundancy**

**High Availability**  

**Disaster Recovery**  

### Recovery Objectives
**Recovery Point Objectives**  

**Recover Time Objective**
