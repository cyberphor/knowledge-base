# Business Needs Analysis
Business needs analysis is when you (1) define a business goal, (2) discover a capability gap, and (3) develop a plan to address it. It's "step zero" in designing a cloud solution.

What are the goals of your business? 
* Increase profits
* Reduce costs

How do you align IT with the goals of your business?
* Identify business/user IT requirements (what do they need from IT to achieve their goals?) 
* Conduct usability and security tests to assess effectiveness

What are some business-focused requirements for IT?
* Inexpensive (e.g., OpEx and CapEx)
* Compatible with existing data sources, legacy software, and partners
* High compute, storage, and network capacity
* High availability (e.g., through redundancy) 
* High resiliency (does the cloud continue to function when there's an issue?)
* Compliant with regulatory requirements (HIPAA, PII, PCI DSS, etc.)
* Multiple computing environments (e.g., development, staging, production)

What are some user-focused requirements for IT?
* Easy-to-use interfaces
* Ubiquitous access (i.e., the system is accessible from almost anywhere) 
* High reliability 
* Fast support response times
