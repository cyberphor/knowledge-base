# Security
Security is a process for ensuring assets are used by authorized personnel in accordance with organizational policies. 

### Shared Responsibility Model
The Shared Responsibility Model (SRM) is a cloud security policy. It separates cloud security responsibilities between Cloud Security Providers (CSPs) and organizations based on service classes (e.g., IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS). 

## Risk Management
Risk management is the process of designing, building, sustaining, and modifying policies and systems to protect asset Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability from *manageable risk*. It requires organizations to define their risk acceptance level and be adaptable. Preserving the organization is more important than preserving an asset. 

**Manageable Risk**  
Manageable risk can be avoided, mitigated, or transferred. 

**Unmanageable Risk**  
Unmanageable risk must be accepted. Examples of unmanageable risk is global catastrophic events and unforeseeable technology failures. 

### Risk Assessment
The first step of risk management if conducting a risk assessment. 

#### The FAIR Framework
The Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) framework is a risk assessment process used to measure the impact of an asset compromise would have on an organization.
