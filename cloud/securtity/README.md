# Security
Security is a process for ensuring assets are used by authorized personnel in accordance with organizational policies. 

**Cloud Security**
The responsibility of cloud security is *shared* between developers, administrators, and Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). 
* Developers: responsible for resource design flaws
* Administrators: responsible for resource misconfigurations
* CSPs: responsible for data center security (NOTE: organizations surrender a portion of integrity control to the CSP)

# Risk Management
Risk management is the process of designing, building, sustaining, and modifying policies and systems to protect asset Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability from *manageable risk*. It requires organizations to understand their risk appetite and be adaptable (preserving the organization is more important than preserving an asset). 

**Manageable Risk**  
Manageable risk can be accepted, avoided, mitigated, or transferred. 

## FAIR
The Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) framework is a risk assessment process for measuring the impact of an incident. 
* Productivity: the ability to provide services
* Response: the capability to mitigate loss
* Replacement: the fix value of a compromised asset
* Fines and Judgements: the legal/regulatory cost sustained  
* Competitive Advantage: the ability for the organization to differentiate itself from other competitors
* Reputation: the damage sustained to the organization's image

| Loss Category         | Impact to Confidentiality | Impact to Integrity | Impact to Availability |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Productivity          |                           |                     |                        | 
| Response              |                           |                     |                        | 
| Replacement           |                           |                     |                        | 
| Fines and Judgements  |                           |                     |                        | 
| Competitive Advantage |                           |                     |                        | 
| Reputation            |                           |                     |                        |
