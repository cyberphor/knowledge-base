# Security
Security is a process for ensuring assets are used by authorized personnel in accordance with organizational policies. 

**Cloud Security**
The responsibility of cloud security is *shared* between developers, administrators, and Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). 
* Developers: responsible for resource design flaws
* Administrators: responsible for resource misconfigurations
* CSPs: responsible for data center security (NOTE: organizations surrender a portion of integrity control to the CSP)

# Risk Management
Risk management is the process of designing, building, sustaining, and modifying policies and systems to protect asset Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability from *manageable risk*. It requires organizations to define what their risk acceptance level and be adaptable (preserving the organization is more important than preserving an asset). 

**Manageable Risk**  
Manageable risk can be avoided, mitigated, or transferred. 

**Unmanageable Risk**  
Unmanageable risk must be accepted. Examples of unmanageable risk is global catastrophic events and unforeseeable technology failures. 

## Risk Assessment
Risk assessment is the first step in risk management. 

### The FAIR Framework
The Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) framework is a risk assessment process. It is used to measure the impact of an asset compromise.
