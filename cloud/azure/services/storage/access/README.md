# Azure Storage Access
There are four options for optimizing the way your data is stored in Azure. 

## Hot Access Tier
Data labeled with "hot access" is stored in a way to facilitate frequent and fast access (e.g., SSDs and load balancing). 

## Cool Access Tier  
Data labeled with "cool access" is stored for at least 30 days and optimized to facilitate infrequent and slow access (e.g., SSDs). 

## Cold Access Tier
Data labeled with "cold access" is stored for at least 90 days and optimized to facilitate infrequent and slow access (e.g., HDDs). 

## Archive Access Tier  
Data labeled with "archive access" is stored for at least 180 days and optimized to facilitate infrequent and slow access (e.g., stored offline).
