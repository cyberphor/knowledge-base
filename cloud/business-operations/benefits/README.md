# Benefits
Cloud computing provides three main benefits to business operations. 

**Utility**  
Cloud computing reduces [Capital Expenditures (CapEx)](/cloud/business-operations/expenditures/README.md#categories) through its elasticity and measured service [characteristics](/cloud/README.md#cloud-elasticity). 

**Process Transformation**  
Cloud computing improves efficiency and collaboration through its on-demand self-service and broad network access [characteristics](/cloud/README.md#cloud-elasticity).

**Business Transformation**  
Cloud computing exposes business operations to new revenue streams. 

## Cloud Characteristics 
| Cloud Characteristic   | Benefit 
| ---------------------- | --------
| On-Demand Self-Service | Reduces CapEx
| Broad Network Access   | Makes it easier to use different clients and "work-from-home"
| Resource Pooling       | Improves hardware utilization and the return-on-investment 
| Rapid Elasticity       | Allows businesses to meet demand and improve profitability
| Measured Service       | Reduces OpEx is based on the services and capacity used

## Cloud Service Models
| Cloud Service Model    | Benefit 
| ---------------------- | --------
| SaaS                   | Reduces both CapEx and OpEx because responsibility for "software and below" is offloaded to the CSP
| PaaS                   | Improves code quality because developers are allowed to focus on writing code instead of hosting it
| IaaS                   | Reduces both CapEx and OpEx because responsibility of the data center is offloaded to the CSP

## Cloud Service Deployment Models
| Cloud Service Deployment Model | Benefit
| ------------------------------ | --------
| Public                         | Reduces both CapEx and OpEx 
| Private                        | Allows the business to maintain control of its data
| Community                      | Allows two or more businesses to share resources
