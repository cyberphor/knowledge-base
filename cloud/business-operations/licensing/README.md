# Licensing
A license represents authorization to use something (e.g., software or service).

## Licensing Types
**Perpetual License**
In a Perpetual-based License model, customers are licensed forever and billed upfront. The ROI is not guaranteed and scaling will become a problem. 

**Subscription Licensing**  
In a Subscription-based License model, customers are licensed as long as they pay for what they used. This model will become more expensive than a Perpetual License model. 

**Bring Your Own License**  
In a Bring Your Own License (BYOL) model, customers are already licensed and don't need to purchase additional licenses before migrating to the cloud.
