# Cloud Service Providers
Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) offer computing resources as a utility. Microsoft, Amazon, and Google are CSPs (the alternative to a CSP would be running a data center yourself). 

## Services
**License Management**  
CSPs can help mitigate license violations and overspending. A *license* represents authorization to use something (e.g., software or service).
* Perpetual License: customers are licensed forever and billed upfront (the ROI is not guaranteed and scaling will become a problem)
* Subscription Licensing: customers are licensed as long as they pay for what they used (this will become more expensive than a Perpetual License model)
* Bring Your Own License: customers are already licensed and don't need to purchase additional licenses before migrating to the cloud

**Time to Market**  
CSPs can help reduce the length of time between developing an idea and making it available to a customer. 

**Managed Service Providers**  
CSPs can help manage the design, deployment, migration, or management of your cloud resources. If you use a third-party, they would be called a Managed Service Provider (MSP).
