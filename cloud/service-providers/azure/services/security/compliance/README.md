## Azure Policy
Azure Policy is a service for managing *resource policies* and *initatives*. Once a policy is defined, Azure Policy will perform the functions listed below. Azure Policy can integrate with Azure DevOps. 
* Identify resources that are not compliant
* Prevent the creation of non-compliant resources 

**Resource Policy**  
A resource policy defines how a resource must be configured. Resource polices are used for compliance requirements. If you define a resource policy at a parent scope, it will be inherited by child scopes. 

**Initiative**  
An initiative is a group of resource policies.
