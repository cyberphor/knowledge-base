# Azure Data Lake
Azure Data Lake is used for storing large volumes of structured and unstructured data. It's based on Apache Hadoop. 

## Versions
There's two versions, or "generations," of Azure Data Lake. Gen1 is a dedicated service. Gen2 is provided via Azure Blob Storage. Gen2 requires the storage account to have the "hierarchal namespace" feature enabled.
