# Containers

A container is a unit of software that includes the code and dependencies it needs to run. 

## Application Architecture Styles
**Monolithic Applications**  
A monolithic app aggregates its components (e.g., UI, business logic, and data access) 

**Microservice Architecture**  
A microservice app seperates components. 
* Independent services
* Loosely coupled
* Well-defined APIs
  * A well-defined API is a common language 
* Every microservice has its own compute, runtime, and team
* Microservices can run on bare metal, virtual machines, containers, and/or the cloud

## Cloud-Native Applications
Cloud-native apps are defined by the following properties. 
* The software is more stable than its infrastructure
* The software is designed to anticipate failure
 
**Elements of Cloud-Native Application**
