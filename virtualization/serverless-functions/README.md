# Serverless Functions
Serverless functions allow you to run an app in response to an event. They can be invoked manually (e.g., HTTP or gRPC request) or on a schedule. 

**Stateless Functions**  
Stateless functions do not remember context. 

**Stateful Functions**  
Stateful functions (aka "durable functions") use context passed to them to simulate state.
