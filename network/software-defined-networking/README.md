# Software-Defined Networking
Software-Defined Networking (SDN) separates networking interfaces (e.g., ports) into Data and Control Planes. 

## Data Plane  
The Data Plane includes trunk and access ports. It's used for forwarding traffic within and between subnets. 

## Control Plane 
The Control Plane includes management interfaces and is hosted on a dedicated server called a "Controller."
