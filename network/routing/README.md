## Multi-Protocol Label Switching
The Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) protocol uses labels to decide where to route packets (instead of IP address lookups). 

## Virtual Routing and Forwarding
Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) is when a router uses multiple virtual routing tables instead of just one. VRF allows you to route traffic to multiple routes without needing additional routers.
