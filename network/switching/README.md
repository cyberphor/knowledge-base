## Virtual Local Area Network
A Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) separates traffic between switch ports using tags. A router is needed to forward traffic between VLANs. The maximum number of VLANs a switch can support is 4096. 

## Virtual Extensible Local Area Network
Virtual Extensible Local Area Networks (VXLANs) allows network administrators to host over 16 million VLANs.
