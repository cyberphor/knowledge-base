# Data Analysis

We can categorize data based on how their structured or stored. 

Data Types
* Structured 
  * Quantitative
    * Discrete: integer or whole number (e.g., children per family, bikes sold per day)
    * Continuous: any value with fractions (e.g., temperature, height, time, age)
  * Qualitative
    * Nominal: named categories
    * Ordinal: categories with order
* Semi-structured 
* Unstructured

Data Storage Types
* Text 
* Binary 

Data Processing Approach
* Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)
  * Source system: CSV, JSON, XML, etc.
  * Clean, normalize, etc.
  * Destination system
* Extract, Load, and Transform (ELT)
  * Source system: CSV, JSON, XML, etc.
  * Destination system
  * Clean, normalize, etc.

Data Visualization
* Bar charts: compare categorical data
* Line charts: show changes over time
* Pie charts: 
* Scatter plots: shows relationship between two numerical variables (used to identifer correlation and outliers)
* Histogram: show frequency or proportion of numerical data
* Box plots: shows the average, median, etc. of data

Data Visualization Pitfalls
* Using more variables than needed
* Using the wrong visualization
* Using the scale of given data the wrong way (i.e., zooming in or out too much)
* Drawing attention to the wrong insight (separating charts when they should be combined)
* Confusing correlation as casuation
* Ignoring important attributes of your data

Data Visualization Best Practices
* Consider colorblindness
* The less color the better
* Use different colors to differentiate variables
