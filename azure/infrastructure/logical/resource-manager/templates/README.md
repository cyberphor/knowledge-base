# Azure Resource Manager Request Templates
ARM supports two templates for resource action requests: *ARM templates* and *Bicep templates*. Both are considered examples of Infrastructure-as-Code. 

## ARM Templates
ARM templates are written in JSON and provide the following benefits. 
* They use a declarative syntax
* They provide consistency
* They creates resources in the correct order
* They are modular (i.e., can be separated into different files)
* They are extendable (i.e., you can add PowerShell scripts to your templates)

## Bicep Templates
Bicep templates provide the following benefits. 
* They are easier to read than ARM templates (i.e., JSON)
* They support all resource types and ARM versions
