# Costs

## Cost Factors
The cost to use Azure is determined by the factors described below. 

**Resource Type**  
Some resources are more expensive than others. 

**Consumption**  
Reserve capacity in advance to take advantage of the discounts offered by Azure. 

**Maintenance**  
Deprovision resources when they are no longer needed to reduce cost. 

**Geography**  
Different regions will show different prices for the same resource type. 

**Network Traffic**  
Putting data in Azure is mostly free. Getting data out of Azure is not. Azure maintains a "bandwidth pricing page."

**Subscription Type**  
Azure offers four different subscription types with varying costs. 

*Free Trial*  
Free trial subscriptions include $200 for any service for the first 30 days. 

*Pay-As-You-Go*  
Pay-As-You-Go subscriptions are billed monthly for the services you use. 

*Enterprise Agreement*  
Enterprise agreement subscriptions allow you to purchase multiple licenses and services under one agreement. They sometimes offered discounts for new licenses and Software Assurance. 

*Azure for Students*  
Azure for Students subscriptions include $100 for any service within the first 12 months. A credit-card is not required at registration. Verify your student status using your school email. 

**Azure Marketplace**  
Products purchased in the Azure Marketplace may include paying for third-party services (e.g., paying for SonarQube's vulnerability scanner).
