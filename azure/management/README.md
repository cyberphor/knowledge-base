# Azure Management

**Capacity Planning**  
Capacity planning is when an organization measures the utilization of existing services to establish a benchmark for future expansion. Below are some examples:
* If one cabinet can support 1,000 users, two additional cabinets would be needed for the organization to support 3,000. 
* If 5 licenses can support 100 servers, 6 licenses would be needed to support up to 120.
