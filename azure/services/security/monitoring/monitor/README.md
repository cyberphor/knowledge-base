# Azure Monitor
Azure Monitor is a [PaaS](/cloud/concepts/README.md#cloud-service-models) offering and monitoring tool.  

## Insights
### Application Insights  
Application Insights is a feature used for Application Performance Monitoring and detecting performance anomalies. To monitor an app, you can (1) use the Applications Insight SDK within your app or (2) install and configure an Application Insights agent (it includes support for Java, Python, etc). 

**Availability Tests**  
Availability tests are used to check if an app is responding as expected. After an availability test is configured, the Application Insights agent will send web requests to your app from around the world. Then, it will notify you if the app is responding slowly or not at all. 
* Classic Test: A "Classic Test" with default settings will test the availability of your web app from five different locations every 5 minutes (the standard of success is the receipt of a HTTP response status 200 within 120 seconds).
