# Storage Options

## Redundancy Options

### Primary Regions
There is always three copies of your data in your storage account's primary region. Yet, data is replicated using either *Locally Redundant Storage (LRS)* or *Zone Redundant Storage (ZRS)*.

**Locally Redundant Storage**  
LRS replicates your data within in the same data center (i.e., all three copies are in the same building). 

**Zone-Redundant Storage**  
ZRS replicates your data between three separate availability zones (i.e., one copy per building). By definition, ZRS provides *high-availability*. 

### Secondary Regions
Using an secondary region to store another copy of your data provides *high durability*. Data between primary and secondary regions is replicated using either *Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS)* or *Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage (GZRS)*.

**Geo-Redundant Storage**  

**Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage**
