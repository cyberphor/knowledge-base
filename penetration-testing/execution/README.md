**Agents**

**Single Payloads**  
Single payloads are self-contained and do not need to download anything before executing a payload (e.g., create a user or start an agent). This is why they are also known as "droppers."

**Staged Payloads**  
Staged payloads require additional software from the C2 server before exploitng the target. For this reason, they are also known as "downloaders."
